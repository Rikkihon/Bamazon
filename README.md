This program will display the items for sale.  The user will enter the order number they'd like to buy and the quantity. 
The system will check to see if that quantity is available and then order it for the user, while displaying the order number and the price. 

The program does this by storing the data in the mySQL database. It will contain item number, quantity, item description, and price. 
Then the node.js will run an inquirer prompt to ask the user how many items they would like, provide the price, cost, order number and then update the database with the final number of items available. 
Then the program will update the database. 

mySQL and inquirer are required to run this.
